**Project name**: ***Microfluidic Flow Control*** :sweat_drops:

**Project Description**

An optimization/debugging tool for microfluidic experiments using an FPGA, where control is defined by a set of instructions. The processor implemented on the FPGA executes the instrcutions and controls RC Servo motors which in turn actuate a valve in Microfluidic circuits.

**Target Board** : ZynqÂ®-7000 All Programmable SoC XC7Z020-CLG484-1

Please refer the **Readme.pdf** for details on replicating the project.
