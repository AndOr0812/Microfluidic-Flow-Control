# Microfluidic-Flow-Control- Summer 2018
This section has codes, testbenches, a system diagram and FSMs for the work done on the Microfluidics project over Summer 2018.
Please find below a brief description of the material:
The folder FullSystemVerilogMemory contains code which has been tested on the FPGA and works as per the requirement. Instructions
are given to the processor using an initial block in an memory module.
FullyIntegrated is the complete system with the UART integrated with the processor which is partially working when tested on hardware.
Independent working modules for XADC and UART are in their respective folders.
Appropriate constraint files and testbenches are included in the folders.
